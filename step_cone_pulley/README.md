# Step-cone pulley optimization

This study investigates the optimal design of a step-cone pulley. Although the design of the step- cone pulley is simple, it has wide applicability and is commonly used in mechanical systems, such as drilled presses and lathes, to easily change the output speed or power. A step-cone pulley can be defined as series of pulleys in decreasing circumference, stacked on top of one another forming a stepped cone. The step-cone pulley is mainly used to vary the velocity ratios of shafts, allowing shifting the speed of the pulley's movements, with a smaller circumference requiring less work but also producing less work. The increasing costs and intense competition as result of globalization and the recent economic crisis have emphasized the need of manufacturing at the lowest cost possible. However, the minimization of cost should not compromise the structural performance of the step-cone pulley system. Therefore, the motivation for performing an optimization study was to determine optimal dimensions that will minimize manufacturing cost subject to design, performance and structural constraints. The optimization study involved different algorithms and a sensitivity analysis, revealing the different trade-offs as well as providing insights regarding the choice of the design.
